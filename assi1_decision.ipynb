    "Q1. Describe the decision tree classifier algorithm and how it works to make predictions.\n",
    "'''\n",
    "A decision tree classifier is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification tasks.\n",
    "It splits the data into subsets based on the value of input features, creating a tree-like structure of decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "How It Works\n",
    "1.Starting at the Root:\n",
    "The algorithm begins at the root node, which contains the entire dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Splitting the Data:\n",
    "At each node, the algorithm selects the best feature to split the data. This selection is \n",
    "based on criteria such as Gini impurity, entropy (information gain), or other impurity measures.\n",
    "The best feature is the one that results in the most significant reduction in impurity.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Creating Child Nodes:\n",
    "The data is split based on the selected features values, and child nodes are created for each split.\n",
    "This process is repeated recursively for each child node.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Stopping Criteria:\n",
    "The recursion continues until a stopping criterion is met. This could be a predefined maximum depth of the tree,\n",
    "a minimum number of samples in a node, or a minimum impurity reduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Making Predictions:\n",
    "For a given input, the decision tree traverses from the root to a leaf node by following the splits based\n",
    "on the input feature values.\n",
    "The class label assigned to the leaf node is the predicted class for the input."
